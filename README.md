<b>Scope</b><br/>
MediCare is a medicine reminder application with multiple additional features like automated medicine<br/> detection with barcode scanning,
find nearby pharmacies and locate medical professional with specific criterias.<br/>
The system consists of a barcode scanner to scan the prescribed medicine information to acquire the details and dosages. <br/>
For this feature, we depend on the web service architecture to acquire medication details. <br/>
Secondly, the system will set up reminders for the prescribed medication as per the dosage. <br/>
These reminders can be notified to the user through various display, sound and vibration techniques. <br/>
These reminders will also be added as the calendar event. <br/>
Additionally, an emergency contact is set up to send text or email alert in case of any emergency situations.<br/>
